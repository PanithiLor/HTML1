        <b>Ornamental fish</b> are species of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" target="_blank">fish</a> that are kept
        primarily
        for their aesthetic value rather than for practical
        purposes like food or work. They are often bred and selected for their striking colors, patterns, and shapes.
        These
        fish are commonly kept in home aquariums, garden ponds, and public displays.
